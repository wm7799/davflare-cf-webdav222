← [README](../README.md)

Create keys in the web UI: ExplorerBar 「API」 or account menu 「开放接口」. Full keys are shown once; only SHA-256 hashes are stored. Auth is `Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>` or `X-Api-Key: <apiKey>` (no web session). Manage keys via session-authenticated `GET` / `POST` / `DELETE` `/api/keys`. Usage docs are also on the API settings page.

If the **API Key** feature switch is off, Bearer / `X-Api-Key` calls fail with **401**. The web session (Basic) APIs keep working. **MCP requires API Key**: `POST /mcp` is **404** when either the MCP switch or the API Key switch is off.

Owner feature flags live in R2 (`_$flaredrive$/config.json`). `GET /api/config` (session) returns `username`, `publicRead`, `sitesHost`, and `webdav` / `mcp` / `apiKey` / `sites` / `imageHost` (all default **true**). `PATCH /api/config` with a JSON object of those booleans is **Basic session only** — presenting `Bearer` or `X-Api-Key` returns **403**.

`GET /api/setup` (Basic session only) runs the post-deploy checklist (R2, WebDAV PROPFIND, flags, `SITES_HOST`, MCP `tools/list`) used by `#/setup`. See [deploy.md](./deploy.md).

Internal `_$flaredrive$/` keys are rejected. Operations covering more than 1000 objects return **400** and must be batched.

### Upload

Default `POST /api/upload` uniqueNames collisions (`name (2).ext`). Add `?overwrite=1` (or `true`) to PUT/replace the same path + filename.

```bash
# multipart
curl -X POST "https://<your-domain.com>/api/upload?path=folder/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>" \
  -F "file=@photo.jpg"

# also accepts X-Api-Key, or a raw body with X-File-Name
curl -X POST "https://<your-domain.com>/api/upload?path=docs/" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: <apiKey>" \
  -H "X-File-Name: notes.txt" \
  --data-binary @notes.txt

# overwrite upload
curl -X POST "https://<your-domain.com>/api/upload?path=folder/&overwrite=1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>" \
  -F "file=@photo.jpg"
```

Single-request uploads are limited to about 100 MB (**HTTP 413** otherwise). Larger files use the 3-step multipart API:

```bash
# 1) create
curl -X POST "https://<your-domain.com>/api/upload?uploads&path=folder/big.bin" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>"
# → 201 { key, uploadId }

# 2) upload each part (≤100MB per request, partNumber 1..10000)
curl -X PUT "https://<your-domain.com>/api/upload?path=folder/big.bin&uploadId=<id>&partNumber=1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>" \
  --data-binary @part1.bin
# → 200 { partNumber, etag }

# 3) complete with the collected parts (order matters)
curl -X POST "https://<your-domain.com>/api/upload?path=folder/big.bin&uploadId=<id>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"parts":[{"partNumber":1,"etag":"..."},{"partNumber":2,"etag":"..."}]}'

# abort an unfinished upload
curl -X DELETE "https://<your-domain.com>/api/upload?path=folder/big.bin&uploadId=<id>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>"
```

### List, download, mkdir

The same keys can list a folder and download each file. Single-file download stays on `/api/download`. To zip a folder **without** creating a public share link, use authenticated `/api/archive` (or the MCP `zip` tool). Directory shares still work when you want a link.

```bash
# Depth-1 list (empty path = root). Does not recurse.
curl "https://<your-domain.com>/api/list?path=folder/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>"

# download each item where isDir is false
curl -L "https://<your-domain.com>/api/download?path=folder/notes.txt" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>" \
  -o notes.txt

# also accepts X-Api-Key
curl -L "https://<your-domain.com>/api/download?path=folder/notes.txt" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: <apiKey>" \
  -o notes.txt

# zip a folder (or single file) — streams application/zip; no public share link
curl -L "https://<your-domain.com>/api/archive?path=folder/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>" \
  -o folder.zip

# multi-select zip (same body the web UI uses); Basic session or API key
curl -X POST "https://<your-domain.com>/api/archive" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"keys":["folder/a.txt","folder/sub/"]}' \
  -o archive.zip
```

`GET /api/list` returns `{ items: [{ key, name, size, isDir, uploaded, etag }] }` for the current folder only. Files always include numeric `size`, ISO `uploaded` (and alias `updated`), and R2 `etag`. Delimited-prefix folders have `isDir: true`, `size: 0`, and `uploaded: null` (unknown; no fake mtime). Nested folders: call `/api/list` again with that item's `key`. If `path` is a file, the list API returns **400** and tells you to use `/api/download`. Missing folder: **404**. Bad/expired key: **401**. Large folders: add `limit=1..1000` (plus `cursor` from the previous response) for paged reads — the response then carries `nextCursor` while more pages remain.

`GET /api/download` `path` is the object key. **HTTP 200** streams the file (`Content-Type` from R2 or `application/octet-stream`, `Content-Disposition: attachment`). Missing/empty path or a directory/prefix folder returns **400**; unknown object **404**; bad/expired key **401**. Internal `_$flaredrive$/` keys are rejected.

`GET /api/archive?path=` zips one folder or file with the same Bearer / `X-Api-Key` (or web Basic session). **HTTP 200** streams `application/zip`. Folder keys strip the folder prefix inside the zip (same as directory shares). Missing path **400**; unknown path **404**; bad/expired key **401**. Internal `_$flaredrive$/` keys are rejected. `POST /api/archive` with `{ "keys": [...] }` packs multiple selections (web UI multi-download); same auth and internal-key rules.

Create folders from scripts (parents are auto-created):

```bash
# JSON body or ?path= both work. 201 created / 200 already exists / 409 same-name file
curl -X POST "https://<your-domain.com>/api/mkdir" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"path":"folder/sub"}'
```

### Backup, rename, delete

```bash
# conflict backup: rename remote to name.conflict-YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS.ext (UTC)
curl -X POST "https://<your-domain.com>/api/backup?path=folder/notes.txt" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>"

# rename (409 if `to` exists unless overwrite=1; directories move recursively, no overwrite)
curl -X POST "https://<your-domain.com>/api/rename" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"from":"folder/old.txt","to":"folder/new.txt"}'

# delete a file only
curl -X DELETE "https://<your-domain.com>/api/delete?path=folder/notes.txt" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>"

# soft delete (goes to the recycle bin, restorable; works for directories too)
curl -X DELETE "https://<your-domain.com>/api/delete?path=folder/notes.txt&soft=1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>"

# delete a whole directory recursively (≤1000 objects per call)
curl -X DELETE "https://<your-domain.com>/api/delete?path=folder/sub" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>"
```

`/api/rename` and `/api/delete` accept directories — rename moves the whole tree, delete removes it recursively (hard delete unless `soft=1`). `/api/backup` on a directory renames the whole tree to `name.conflict-<UTCstamp>`. Operations covering more than 1000 objects return **400** and must be batched.

### Shares

`POST /api/shares` accepts a folder key too — visiting the share link streams the whole tree as a zip download (extract code and expiry apply as usual). Share management (`GET`/`POST`/`DELETE /api/shares`) accepts **both** the web session (Basic) and an API key, so scripts and MCP can create/list/revoke shares.

`GET /share/<token>` (no auth) returns a **server-rendered, zero-JS landing page** (light/dark via `prefers-color-scheme`, language via `Accept-Language`): file name, type, size, shared time, plus inline preview (`<img>` / `<video>` / `<audio>` / `<iframe>`) for preview-safe types. The download button points at `?download=1`. Query params on the same URL:

- `?download=1` — raw bytes with `Content-Disposition: attachment`. **Scripts that used to download from the plain share link must switch to this** (folders stream the zip either way).
- `?raw=1` — raw bytes inline (`Content-Disposition: inline`) for preview-safe types (image / video / audio / PDF / text); other types still download as an attachment. The response keeps the existing hardening — `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` — and honors `Range` (video seeking / resumable downloads).

Extract-code gating is unchanged and applies to the landing page and both params: the legacy `?code=` query keeps working, the form POST sets a Path-scoped `HttpOnly` cookie, and links rendered on the landing page inherit `?code=` so previews work from old-style links. Expired → **410**, revoked/missing → **404**, wrong code → **403** form.

### Copy, stat, search

```bash
# copy a file (409 if `to` exists unless overwrite=1; directories are not supported)
curl -X POST "https://<your-domain.com>/api/copy" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"from":"folder/a.txt","to":"folder/b.txt"}'

# object metadata (kind file/directory, size, etag, uploaded, contentType)
curl "https://<your-domain.com>/api/stat?path=folder/a.txt" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>"

# search all objects by filename substring (cursor pagination)
curl "https://<your-domain.com>/api/search?q=notes&limit=100" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>"
```

`GET /api/download` sends `Accept-Ranges: bytes` and honors a single `Range` header with **206** responses, so resumable/chunked downloads work with plain HTTP clients.

### Feature flags and image host

```bash
# session only
curl "https://<your-domain.com>/api/config" \
  -u "$WEBDAV_USERNAME:$WEBDAV_PASSWORD"

# PATCH is Basic session only — API keys are rejected (403)
curl -X PATCH "https://<your-domain.com>/api/config" \
  -u "$WEBDAV_USERNAME:$WEBDAV_PASSWORD" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"webdav":false,"imageHost":true}'
```

Image host (Basic session **or** API key, same as `/api/sites`; public bytes are on `SITES_HOST`, not the drive origin):

```bash
# list
curl "https://<your-domain.com>/api/images" -u "$WEBDAV_USERNAME:$WEBDAV_PASSWORD"

# upload (raw body + X-File-Name, or multipart field file)
curl -X POST "https://<your-domain.com>/api/images" \
  -u "$WEBDAV_USERNAME:$WEBDAV_PASSWORD" \
  -H "X-File-Name: shot.png" \
  --data-binary @shot.png

# delete
curl -X DELETE "https://<your-domain.com>/api/images?id=<id>" \
  -u "$WEBDAV_USERNAME:$WEBDAV_PASSWORD"
```

Public URL: `https://<SITES_HOST>/i/{id}`. SVG responses use `Content-Disposition: attachment` and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`.

### MCP

Same-origin Streamable HTTP MCP at `POST /mcp` (JSON-RPC 2.0). Auth is the same `Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>` or `X-Api-Key` as the rest of this API (no web session, no OAuth). **MCP depends on the API Key switch** — if API Key is off (or MCP is off), `/mcp` returns **404**. Missing or invalid keys return **HTTP 401**. Tools: `list`, `upload`, `download`, `zip`, `mkdir`, `delete`, `search`, `move`, `copy`, `stat`, `share_create`, `share_list`, `share_revoke`, `trash_list`, `trash_restore`, `trash_empty`, `sites_list`, `sites_config`, `sites_delete`, `pull`, `push`, `publish_site`, `image_upload`, `image_list`, `image_delete` (they wrap the Open API handlers above). Uploads over 1 MiB are automatically sent in multipart chunks (cap **25 MB**; larger returns a tool error — use the web UI or scripts). Downloads over 1 MiB page with `part` / `partSize` (base64 slices). `zip` packs a folder via `/api/archive` (base64; same 1 MiB / `part` paging; hard cap 25 MB — larger use curl on `/api/archive`). Default `delete` is soft-delete to trash; pass `hard=true` to permanently delete. Recover with `trash_list` / `trash_restore`; permanently clear with `trash_empty`. `sites_*` manage the static sites under `sites/` (see [sites.md](./sites.md)); `upload`/`delete` also work directly on `sites/<slug>/` keys. `pull` walks `agents/{global|agent|agent/project}/{skills|rules|mcp}/` and returns layered files (merge: project > agent > global); large files page like `download`. `push` writes that tree (`mcp.json` must use `${env:...}`, not raw keys). `publish_site` copies a drive folder onto `sites/{slug}/` (overwrite same names; SPA config is kept; 404 if the Sites switch is off). `image_upload` / `image_list` / `image_delete` wrap `/api/images` (public `https://<SITES_HOST>/i/{id}` + Markdown; 20 MB cap; 404 if Image Host is off).

```bash
# initialize
curl -X POST "https://<your-domain.com>/mcp" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-03-26","capabilities":{}}}'

# tools/list
curl -X POST "https://<your-domain.com>/mcp" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list"}'
```

Cursor (`mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "davflare": {
      "url": "https://<your-domain.com>/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <apiKey>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Expiring share from chat

1. Ask the agent to call `share_create` on a file or folder path, with `expiresInHours=24` (optional `extractCode`).
2. Forward the returned share `url` (path `/share/{token}`).
3. Manage with `share_list` / `share_revoke` (pass the `token`).

### Zip a folder from chat (pull back locally)

1. Ask the agent to call `zip` on a folder path (no `share_create`, no public link).
2. Small archives (≤ 1 MiB) come back as base64 — decode and save as `.zip`.
3. Larger ones: pass `part=1`, `part=2`, … (optional `partSize`) and concatenate the base64 slices; or curl `GET /api/archive?path=` with your API key.

### Recover a mistaken delete from chat

1. Soft-deleted via `delete` (default) — the file is in trash.
2. Call `trash_list` to see `trashKey` / `originalKey`.
3. Call `trash_restore` with that `trashKey` to put it back.
4. Or `trash_empty` to permanently clear trash.

### Try MCP from Cursor

In-browser playground: open `#/mcp` (also linked from `#/settings`), paste an API Key, run **List tools** (`tools/list`) and **Try it** (read-only `list` on root), then copy Cursor `mcp.json` when both are green. Same `POST /mcp` — no new APIs.

1. Leave **API Key** + **MCP** + **Sites** on in `#/settings`. Create a key.
2. Paste into Cursor `mcp.json` (replace host + key) — same JSON as above.
3. Open this repo's [`agents/examples/hello-site/`](../agents/examples/hello-site/) and tell Cursor to follow `SKILL.md` (uses only `publish_site` / optional `image_upload`).
4. When it finishes you get `https://sites.<your-domain>/hello/` (your real `SITES_HOST`). No public shared demo.

### Agent layouts

Skills / rules / MCP snippets: `agents/{global|{agent}|{agent}/{project}}/{skills|rules|mcp}/`. v2 `pull` / `push` walk this tree (or use the web UI). Merge: project > agent > global. Do not store raw keys in `mcp.json`. Full convention: [agents.md](./agents.md).

### Bidirectional sync recipe

Local wins; backup remote on conflict. Same Bearer / `X-Api-Key` auth as upload; no web session. WebDAV protocol is unchanged.

1. List with `GET /api/list` and compare local mtime/size/etag vs remote `uploaded` / `size` / `etag`.
2. Local-only new/changed → `POST /api/upload?overwrite=1`.
3. Remote-only new/changed → `GET /api/download`.
4. Both changed → `POST /api/backup?path=remoteKey` then overwrite-upload local bytes to the original name.
5. Optional local deletes: `DELETE /api/delete` (skip unless the client tracks a sync db). Extra remote-only files: download them.
